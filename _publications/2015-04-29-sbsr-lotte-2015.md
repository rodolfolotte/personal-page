Abstract
======
<h-abstract>The susceptibility to mass movements are natural events normally triggered by the influence of climate factors on certain regions. They are normally favored by endogenous factors such as slope, land use, land cover, geology, and other factors. The impacts of such events are devastating, especially in the case of landslides. The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis techniques, made possible to monitor and mitigate its effect, establishing a criteria to outline areas of risk. In order to identify susceptible areas, some environmental variables are necessary, such as geomorphologic formations, geological, land use, land cover, and especially, the slope of the region. In this work, beyond the use of the previous variables, will be also explored the use of the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) in order to identify susceptible areas of landslides in São Sebastião, SP. This index allows to quantify the environmental variable control of local topography as the hydrological processes, indicating the spatial soil moisture distribution and saturation of the surface. This variable was obtained with the Whitebox GAT 3.2.0 spatial analysis tool. In order to map these areas, spatial techniques of Analytic Hierarchy Process - AHP and Fuzzy-Gamma were used. The results were compared with susceptibility maps without using the TWI index, in order to analyze its impact. Both techniques showed satisfactory results, being Fuzzy-Gamma even more flexible.</h-abstract>

Presentation
======
![image-left]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/papers/sbsr-2015/1/sbsr-lotte-thumb.png){: .align-left} This work has been presented in a poster form (left), during the [XVII National Remote Sensing Symposium (SBSR)](www.sbsr.com.br/), hosted by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), in João Pessoa, Paraíba, 2015. The poster can be download in the green buttom at the top of this page.

Fortunately, this was a special presentation, which beyond the interest of the audience, the poster was awarded as one of the eight best posters presented during the event.
