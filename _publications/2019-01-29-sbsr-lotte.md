Abstract
=======
<h-abstract>Nowadays, by the use of intelligent techniques, every single letter, word, face, car, urban object, and many others, can be easily interpreted by a computer once it is filmed or pictured. Observing people movements, car traffics, are examples of information that can be automatically mapped by a computer. Once interpreted, thousands of insights are generated, and the way the things are currently implemented could be positively redirected. In case of strategic planning, the mapping of urban elements can reveal much about the urban context, thereby helping to determine the application of environmental and urbanization policies. In this paper we discuss the benefits on the availability of devices, platforms, the wide-spread technologies in terms of cloud services, intelligent algorithms on detection and reconstruction. What has been done to associate all those alternatives to better project urban planning? Or how to associate each of these extracted information and use them to analyse or even predict daily life situations? The discussion presented in this document, takes Brazil as object of study to show how the recent technologies will help the government to better serve the population.</h-abstract>

Presentation
======
![image-left](/assets/images/papers/sbsr-2019/poster-2019-thumb.jpg){: .align-left} This work has been presented in a poster form (left), during the [XIX National Remote Sensing Symposium (SBSR)](www.sbsr.com.br/), hosted by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), in Santos, São Paulo, 2019. The poster can be download in the green buttom at the top of this page.

Fortunately, this was a special presentation, which beyond the interest of the audience, the poster was awarded as one of the eight best posters presented during the event.
