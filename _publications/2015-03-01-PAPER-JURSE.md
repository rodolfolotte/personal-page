Abstract
=======
<h-abstract>Classifiers that make use of pixel-by-pixel approaches are limited in the high spatial and radiometric resolution of intra-urban regions. That happens because of noise in the image and confusion in the targets spectral response that display similarity in it’s signal like: ceramic roofs and bare soil. Because of that, the literature favors approaches that make use of object-oriented analysis for image segmentation, those approaches make a better use of the high spatial resolution and don’t use only the target’s spectral response. Assuming that the object-oriented analysis is a favorable approach to be implemented in intra-urban areas, this paper will assess the results of such approach through an implementation of it in an urbanized area from the city of Campinas (Brazil), which has a size close to twelve square kilometers. Making use of the fusion of high spatial resolution image from Worldview-2 sensor and it’s panchromatic band, the experiments were performed with the use of E-Cognition TM Developer 8 as the segmentation platform, and the classification being based on a decision tree generated by C4.5 algorithm on the software WEKA. This work also assess which approach best suits the experiment needs, being an optimal attribute selection achieved through a Wrapper filter, with a final kappa statistic of 0.9425.</h-abstract>

Contextualization
=======

<!-- O propósito básico deste trabalho foi a extração automática de redes de estradas e da investigação quanto a possibilidade de aplicação de Modelos de Contorno Ativo (de curvas aberto) sobre imagens SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), cuja visibilidade topográfica sobre regiões recobertas por copas de árvores ou núvens é alta. Isto aumenta o poder de investigação sobre áreas em que há estradas ilegais, por exemplo, para contrabando de mercadorias, trafico de drogas, assentamentos ilegais, etc.  -->
