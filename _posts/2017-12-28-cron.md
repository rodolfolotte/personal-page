Have you wondered in which situation should you used `cron` or `at` to schedule your jobs in Linux? So, here it is...

`cron` is used to schedule tasks at the same time repeatedly, for instance, every 15 minutes:

`*/15 * * * * MY_PATH/myscript.sh`

`at`, on the other hand, is used to schedule tasks only once. Using the same example above, every 15 minutes from now:

`at now +15 minutes MY_PATH/myscript.sh`
