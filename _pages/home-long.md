<p>I'm a bachelor's degree in Systems Analysis from the University of Franca (UNIFRAN), Franca, in São Paulo, where I studied between 2006 and 2009, concluding with the award for best thesis by the university itself.</p>

<p>In early 2010, I started my master's degree in Applied Computing at the <a href="http://www.inpe.br/">National Institute for Space Research (INPE)</a>, in São José dos Campos, SP. In this institute, I not only had my first academic experiences but also professional/practical experiences in project development and management, as I describe below. During my master's degree (completed in late 2012), my research involved developing a road extractor using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images and Active Contour Models (Snakes). Simultaneously, I started my first commercial experiences in 2011 when I worked as a developer and systems analyst in the <a href="http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/en/">Brazilian Monitoring Space Weather Program (EMBRACE/INPE)</a>. In these almost two years, I worked mainly with Java under an agile development model, where we had to propose and develop applications for space monitoring—always focusing on real-time responses. These applications had to handle receiving observed data within our local servers and producing user-friendly visualizations.</p>

<p>After finishing my master's degree in Applied Computing, I moved to Hannover, Germany, where I worked at the University of Hannover’s <a href="https://www.ipi.uni-hannover.de/">Institute of Geoinformation and Photogrammetry - IPI</a>, performing pattern recognition activities on SAR (radar) images, primarily using C. Then, on the same project, I worked with other tools but with different goals at the University of Pavia (UPV), Pavia, Italy.</p>

<p>In 2014, I returned to Brazil and started my PhD in Remote Sensing at INPE, focusing on extracting information from buildings in large urban centers, such as facade details using Deep Learning and Structure-from-Motion (3D) - SfM. In parallel, I returned to <a href="http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/en/">(EMBRACE/INPE)</a> in 2016, working on space weather and monitoring applications. In July 2017, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the <a href="http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/">Department of Photogrammetry (IfP)</a> at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.</p>

<p>Returning to Brazil in early 2018, I defended my PhD in August 2018. In April 2018, I resumed my work at <a href="http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/en/">(EMBRACE/INPE)</a>, where I contributed to the development of <a href="http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/tec-map-inicio/">TECMap</a>, an ionospheric-GNSS model that infers GNSS signal bias and ionosphere density. I remained there until April 2019, when I joined <a href="http://www.geopx.com.br/">Geopixel Geotechnology and IT Solutions</a>, São José dos Campos, São Paulo, as a Technical Lead in Remote Sensing in June 2019. My activities mainly included coordinating urban mapping projects and services for city halls, such as real estate cadastre updates, WebGIS development, planning, training, and research.</p>

<p>In 2020, I joined the Observação da Terra department at INPE, integrating the team of the <a href="http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes">Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Program (PRODES)</a>, where I worked as a Scientific Developer. PRODES is nationally recognized for its Amazon monitoring efforts over the past 20 years. I held this position until November 2020, when I transitioned to <a href="https://www.sccon.com.br/">Santiago & Cintra Consultoria (SCCON)</a> in São Paulo, Brazil, as a Specialist in Computer Vision and Remote Sensing. In this role, I focused on AI-driven geospatial analysis and automated feature extraction, remaining with SCCON until July 2023.</p>

<p>Since July 2023, I have been working at <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/br/pt.html">Deloitte</a> as an AI & Data Lead, coordinating projects in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Remote Sensing. My role involves leading AI-driven initiatives, designing and implementing geospatial intelligence solutions, and managing teams working with data-driven strategies.</p>

<p>In February 2025, I earned an <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/57bd977e-e645-4d4d-a40c-79e783deb4d5/linked_in_profile">AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification (SAA-C03)</a>, validating my expertise in cloud architecture. Additionally, I began a post-graduate program in Machine Learning Engineering 4.0 at <a href="https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/">Data Science Academy (DSA)</a>, further expanding my knowledge in scalable AI solutions.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have gained expertise in Python, Java, and C, applying methodologies such as SCRUM, SOLID, and Agile development. I have experience in large-scale data analysis, feature extraction, and automation for remote sensing applications. I am also a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-programmer6-certification.html">Sun Certified Java Programmer - Platform SE 6.0 (SCJP 6.0)</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond my primary roles, I provide consulting in Geotechnologies, Remote Sensing, and Machine Learning, specializing in automated feature extraction, cartographic analysis, and AI-driven spatial intelligence.</p>
