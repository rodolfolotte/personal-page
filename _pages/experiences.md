The PRODES project performs satellite monitoring of recent deforestation in the Legal Amazon and produces, since 1988, annual deforestation rates in the region, which are used by the Brazilian government to establish public policies. The annual rates are estimated based on the deforestation increments identified in each satellite image that covers the Legal Amazon. The first presentation of the data is made for December of each year, in the form of an estimate. The consolidated data are presented in the first half of the following year ([Read More](http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes)).

Other uses include mineral prospecting, non-destructive testing of materials, assessment of radio-communication link interference, and satellite attitude control. The INPE Space Weather program uses in its measurements of geomagnetic field variations on the Earth's surface fluxgate magnetometer. In these magnetometers, a nucleus...</h-app> ([Read More](http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/h-variation/))<h-app>.</h-app>

Its main features are: low hardware price, software, short assembly time, and both two or more orders of magnitude below already existing spectrometers. The instrument is sensitive to the physical limit and extremely stable. The total bandwidth is 825 MHz, and the width of the individual channels is 300 kHz. A total of 1000 measurements can be made per second. The spectrometer is well suited for low frequency solar radio relevant for research on the...</h-app> ([Read More](http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/callisto-home/))<h-app>.</h-app>

<h-exp-desc>The TOoLs for Open Multi-risk assessment using Earth Observation data (TOLOMEO) project aimed at, and was able to, developing free/open source tools in the framework of collaborative environment with emphasis on remote sensing analysis tools for risk assessment. The developed software tools have been tested and proved to be robust, easy to use and free. They can thus be used in a collaborative way by researchers and other actors in the Earth Observation (EO) community for extracting information from imagery, and help mapping risk as well as vulnerability and exposure.</h-exp-desc>

The images used, however, is the main challenge in this study. The Snakes technique is most applied under "non-noisy" scenarios. SAR images, used in this work, provide imaging uder areas not imaged by common sensors, with the add of speckle noisy. In this sense, this work comprises ways of to use Snakes under radar images to extract road networks.</h-app>
