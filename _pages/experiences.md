<h-exp-desc>Development, research and management of activities involving remote sensing geoprocessing and facilities to the land-use aerial monitoring.

The use of images of very high spatial and temporal resolution, has become a trend due to the fact that its viability today is more feasible. For example, the availability of storage resources, cloud computing, technologies for handling large amounts of data, among others, are examples of components that support applications involving large amounts of data and, in addition, with high resolution and availability ([Read More](https://www.sccon.com.br/)).

The PRODES project performs satellite monitoring of recent deforestation in the Legal Amazon and produces, since 1988, annual deforestation rates in the region, which are used by the Brazilian government to establish public policies. The annual rates are estimated based on the deforestation increments identified in each satellite image that covers the Legal Amazon. The first presentation of the data is made for December of each year, in the form of an estimate. The consolidated data are presented in the first half of the following year ([Read More](http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes)).

As System Analyst/Developer during a long period at the EMBRACE/INPE, I could learn a bit more about technologies and practices involving the professional development of big projects. Always surrounded by experient people, the EMBRACE/INPE has broght important skills that allowed me to be more prepared over a complex and dynamic field. Besides, the department also provided a wide variability of scientific topics on Astrophysics, such as Solar, Interplanetary Medium, and Earth activities, and the strategies regarding its monitoring. To go a bit through the applications that I got involved, I listed and explained below each of them.
